# Advanced Machine Learning
This repo contains the python source codes to the coding assignments of the course _Advanced Course in Machine Learning_ (University of Helsinki, Data Science Master's Programme, spring 2019).

Themes of the assignments:
- Week 1: Principal component analysis (PCA) / Eigen-value decomposition
- Week 2: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
- Week 3: Spectral clustering
- Week 4: Probabilistic PCA and Stochastic neighbor embedding (SNE)
- Week 5: No coding assigments
- Week 6: Random forest
- Week 7: Neural networks for sequences: Standard fully-connected multi-layer perceptron (MLP); Convolutional neural network (CNN); Recurrent neural network / LSTM

Libraries used:
- Numpy, Scipy, Pandas for basic calculations and data wrangling
- SKLearn for machine learning models, data preprocessing and other ML-tools
- Matplotlib.pyplot and Seaborn for visualizations
- Tensorflow and Keras for neural networks

In some of the assigments the methods were intentionally implemented manually in lower-level code (not using the ready implementations in SKLearn) for learning purposes.

Code was written in Jupyter (IPython) Notebooks and mostly also exported to plain .py files.
